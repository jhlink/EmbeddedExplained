## Transisters: BJTs and MOSFETs  

The latter is prevalent in digital electronics for reasons of performance, cost, and scale.   
The former is common *depending on the application* due to concerns with power consumption, heat, and noise.

Keyterms to Note: 
- [Forward Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction): Direction of easy current flow
- [Reverse Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction): Direction of little or no currrent flow
